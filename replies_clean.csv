@pencilVester05,"@Trainwreckstv Damn yall really think a therapist can change your life?🤣🤣🤣 yall are weird asf. What if somebody in your community has cancer and no insurance do you not do anything about that? Is it only for the times when people in your community think they're ""depressed"" or ""addicted"" ? ☠️"
@Biblical_Battz,@BanterStudi0 @jaddope @Ath3naStake @Trainwreckstv I’ve literally said several times I don’t have a community LMFAOO holy shit you kids are actually brain dead and can’t read. All I said was that that chick didn’t have a community. I never flexed anything about myself 😂😂😂 seek help dude
@Chactories,"@Trainwreckstv I'm definitely onboard for this. Mental health is often overlooked by many, even though it's crucial to our well being. Let's GO!"
